## Introduction

My father always told me that knowledge should be freely available, and I agree. Witnessing the difficulties that most people face while learning and working with react, particularly in finding simple tutorials here and there that are extremely useful knowledge for the beginning phase, but rarely go deep in concepts, patterns, and advanced features.

Also Finding unique content blogs, channels, podcasts it's a big endeavor specially for new comers.

As a result, I wanted to create this booklet to provide a learning step up. It's the result of months of work in which I tried to study my resources and references and present them as simply as possible while also highlighting good examples and edge cases.

If you find this book useful, please feel free to add it to your reading list, bookmark it, or share it with the team. It would also be great if you could star it on Github so that it can reach more hungry minds.

**Disclaimer**

> **It is mandatory to have a good basic knowledge with JavaScript, and DOM manipulation concepts.**

> **I recommend to dive deep in those concept before tackling React and I assure you that not only React will be easier to understand but also anything that involves JavaScript Ecosystem will be easier to digest.**

> **Git book has only a light theme, if you are like me and you like always your reading materials on Dark themed pages, please try this chrome extension**
